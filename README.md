# etch-a-sketch
This project was created as part of the Foundations course for The Odin Project

I worked on JavaScript DOM manipulation and CSS to create a web app of the famous Etch-A-Sketch game.

Some more styling could be added as well as additional features such as:  
-a reset button to clear the grid  
-different pen colors  
-an eraser
